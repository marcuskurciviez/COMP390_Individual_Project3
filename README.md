This third assignment I was able to refactor what the given code was. The test functions I was struggling with and managed to get the first set done, but
I was really having trouble with the rest. Another thing was that in some of the files I would have a little red sguiggly line right after a line, for no
apparent reason. The code works, but the red little line after some of them is there. 

For MAC:
In order to run this file, open up a new terminal window and head to the project folder. Afterwards type in "python 3 jlock.py" and you will be greeted
with a welcome message. From there you can type in "python3 jlock.py -h" to see the list of commands and how to use them in the program.
